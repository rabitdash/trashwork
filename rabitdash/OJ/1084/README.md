题目内容

题目描述:

Your task is to Calculate a + b.

Too easy?! Of course! I specially designed the problem for acm beginners.

You must have found that some problems have the same titles with this one, yes, all these problems were designed for the same aim.

/*注意 多组输入时本oj编译器版本不支持对scanf（）返回值的判断，若这么写会超时。

如 while (scanf("%d",&n)) 则会显示超时

解决办法：

用c++提交，上面语句用 while （cin>>n）代替）*/
输入描述：

The input will consist of a series of pairs of integers a and b, separated by a space, one pair of integers per line.You need use long to record these numbers.

For each pair of input integers a and b you should output the sum of a and b in one line, and with one line of output for each line in input. The result is less than 2^31.
